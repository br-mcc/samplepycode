# Example Python (2.4-2.7) code for newcomers.

Intended to serve as independent, sample modules which demonstrate how generic
programming functions (such as File I/O) and assigning user input to variables
can be accomplished in Python.

Not intended as a full explanation of Python's inner-workings or Object-Oriented
Programming (OOP).  These are quick, functioning examples only.


Reading and Writing to Files (Creating file objects.) --> PythonFileIO.py

Asking for user input and setting to a value. --> PythonUserInput.py
